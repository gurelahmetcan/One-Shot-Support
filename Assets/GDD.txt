📄 GDD: One-Shot Support
Tagline: "One Swing. One Kill. One Star if you mess up." Format: 2D Shopkeeper Simulation / Probability Management

1. Executive Summary
The player acts as a specialist blacksmith/support merchant. Heroes arrive at the shop before a "Boss Fight." These heroes only have the stamina for one single attack. The player must equip them to maximize their "One-Shot" percentage. The game is won or lost based on the shop's Reputation, which fluctuates based on "Slay-Yelp" reviews left by heroes after their fight.

The "One Shot" Limitation
Mechanical: The combat outcome is a binary "Win" or "Loss" based on a single dice roll against a percentage.

Gameplay: The player has a limited daily inventory; choosing to give a "perfect" item to one hero means they won't have it for the next.

2. Core Mechanics (The Logic)
A. The Success Formula
The final percentage chance for a hero to "One-Shot" the monster is calculated as follows:

$$P_{final} = (B + P_{hero}) + \sum(I_{n}) - M_{penalty}$$

Where:
- $P_{final}$: Final Success Percentage (Clamped 1–99%).
- $B$: Hero Base Chance (e.g., 10%).
- $P_{hero}$: Perk Modifier (e.g., -10 for Clumsy).
- $I_{n}$: Sum of equipped item boosts (Base boost + Tag match bonus).
- $M_{penalty}$: Monster Difficulty (e.g., 20 for a Dragon).

B. The Tag System
Monster Weakness: Every monster has one weakness (e.g., SHARP).

Item Category: Every item has one category (e.g., SHARP).

Matching: If Item.Category == Monster.Weakness, the item provides a Matching Bonus (e.g., +40%) instead of a Base Boost (e.g., +15%).

4. The Game Loop (State Machine)

Phase 1: Restock (Morning):

- Generate a list of 5-6 random items from the database.
- Clear the previous day's reviews.

Phase 2: The Consultation (Noon):

- Display a Hero and the Monster they are fighting.
- Player drags items into Hero slots.
- Confidence Meter updates in real-time.
- Player hits "GO" (Hero leaves). Repeat for 3 Heroes.

Phase 3: The Result (Evening):

- System rolls Random(0, 100) for each hero.
- Generate star ratings and text based on the Expectation Matrix.
- Update Reputation Bar.

Phase 4: Day End:

- Check if Reputation <= 0 (Game Over).

5. The Review System (Expectation Matrix)

Confidence	Result	Stars	Reputation
High (>80%)	Win	5 Stars	+10
High (>80%)	Loss	1 Star	-25 (The "Scam" penalty)
Medium (40-79%)	Win	4 Stars	+10
Medium (40-79%)	Loss	2 Stars	-10
Low (<40%)	Win	5 Stars	+25 (The "Miracle" bonus)
Low (<40%)	Loss	3 Stars	-2

6. Technical Implementation Details

- Implementation of Item, Monster, and Hero as ScriptableObjects or Classes.
- UIManager to handle the Slider and the "Review" popup.
- GameManager to handle the Day/Night cycle and the Dice Roll logic.
